# Smart Fishing Alarm - IOS
## Overview
Smart Fishing Alarm (SFA) is a project to create a fishing alarm like no other in the market. The concept is to have a fishing alarm device that can communicate directly with the user's smartphone to notify the fisherman about the catch. To achive this the alarm needs to have a microcontroller that can communicate over Bluetooth Low Energy. By having a smart microcontroller the alarm could be equiped with several sensors that can provide useful information to the users.

This github project holds the source code for the native IOS application that communicates with the alarm devices.
